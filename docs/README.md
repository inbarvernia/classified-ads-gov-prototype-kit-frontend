# Project Description

Frontend for Makers Academy [Scala-Play-MongoDB classified ads backend](https://github.com/makersacademy/scala-play-mongodb-govt-evolving-project/) build using the [GOV.UK frontend prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)

## Implemented features:
- Partial branching and data collection for users' answers
- Results page displays ads from database filtered by advert type selected on `which-advert-type` page
- Due to backend limitations, additional filtering is not yet practically implemented, and sorting currently only works if the selection on `which-advert-type` is something other than `All`
