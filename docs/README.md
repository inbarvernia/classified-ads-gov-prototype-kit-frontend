# Project Description

Frontend for Makers Academy [Scala-Play-MongoDB classified ads backend](https://github.com/makersacademy/scala-play-mongodb-govt-evolving-project/) build using the [GOV.UK frontend prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)

## Implemented features:
- Partial branching and data collection for users' answers
- Results page displays ads from database filtered by advert type selected on `which-advert-type` page
- Results page displays ads based on the sort order selected in `what-display-order`

## Future features:
- A `check-answers` should be displayed before moving on to display results
- Due to current backend limitations, filtering for features other than advert type is not yet practically implemented, but should be fairly straightforward to add once backend functionality has been added
